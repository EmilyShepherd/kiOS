# /etc/hosts: static lookup table for host names
#
# This file exists as it is a requirement for some binaries to have an
# explict rule for localhost. It is possible to add custom static rules
# to this file, however is is normally better to configure these at the
# cluster DNS level.
#
# One usecase for this file can be to allow kiOS to bootstrap and start
# pulling images down in an environment where a DNS server is not
# available, or at a stage in the boot process that the DNS server has
# not yet been determined.
